# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Todo-TaskManager
This is a simple Task Manager web application built with React and Redux. It allows you to add, edit, remove, and filter tasks. You can also switch between light and dark themes.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/YouKnowNikk/task-manager-app.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd task-manager-app
3. Install the project dependencies:
   npm i
   
To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:
   npm start


This will launch the application in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Usage

- Add a new task by entering a title and description and clicking the "Add" button.
- Edit a task by clicking the "Edit" button, making changes, and clicking the "Update" button.
- Remove a task by clicking the "Remove" button.
- Filter tasks by clicking the "All," "Pending," or "Completed" buttons.
- Toggle between light and dark themes by clicking the "Light Theme" or "Dark Theme" button.

### Testing

To run the tests for the application, use the following command:


This will execute the test suite and display the results in the terminal.
